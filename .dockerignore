# Why this matters:
# Even though we're using specific COPY commands in the dockerfile, the entire context is still sent to the Docker daemon first.
# Your .dockerignore prevents these files from being sent to Docker's build context, which: speeds up builds
# (less data to transfer), reduces image size (less stuff copied), prevents secrets leaking (.env files, etc.)

# Build outputs
